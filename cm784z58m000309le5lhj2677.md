Building a cybersecurity lab provides a controlled environment to test and enhance your skills in protecting systems against cyber threats. This guide will walk you through the initial steps of setting up a cybersecurity lab, including downloading necessary software, installing VMware Workstation, and creating virtual machines.

---

We‚Äôll start by downloading the necessary ISO files, installing VMware Workstation, and setting up virtual machines. Let‚Äôs dive in!

## **Lab Environment Setup**

### **Installing VMware Workstation**

VMware Workstation Pro is a powerful virtualization software that allows us to run multiple operating systems on a single machine. Following **Broadcom‚Äôs acquisition of VMware**, the **Pro version is now free for personal use**, making it an excellent choice for setting up our cybersecurity lab.

**Installation Steps:**

1\. Download **VMware Workstation Pro 17** from [Broadcom‚Äôs official website](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-pro.html).

2\. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.

3\. Restart your machine after installation for optimal performance.

### **Downloading ISO Files**

We need two ISO files for our virtual machines:

‚Ä¢ **Windows Server 2019 ISO** ‚Äì Download from Microsoft‚Äôs official [evaluation center](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/).

‚Ä¢ **Windows 10 Evaluation ISO** ‚Äì Also available from [Microsoft's official evaluation center](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/).

* Use the dropdown in the menu to view other available versions.
    

Store these files in an easily accessible location, as we will use them in the next step.

### **Creating Virtual Machines**

We can now create our virtual machines with VMware installed and the ISO files ready.

**Steps:**

1. Open **VMware Workstation** and click **‚ÄúCreate a New Virtual Machine.‚Äù**
    
2. Select **‚ÄúTypical‚Äù installation**.

4. Configure the virtual machine settings:
    
    **CPU & Memory:** At least **2 cores and 4GB RAM** for Windows 10, **4GB RAM** for the server.
    
    > *I am using a laptop with 16GB of RAM; tweak this based on your available RAM. A minimum of 8GB is recommended.*
    
5. **Storage:** **60GB** for the server and **40GB** for the client.
    
6. **Network Adapter:** Set to **‚ÄúVmnet0‚Äù** for isolated lab testing.
    
    **Windows Server 2019 Setup**
    
    1. Select **Windows Server 2019 Standard (Desktop Experience)** to enable GUI.
        
    2. Skip the **Product Key** section.
        
    3. Set an **administrator password** when prompted.
        
    4. Uncheck power on the machine.
        
    5. Click ‚ÄúFinish‚Äù.
        
    6. Edit machine settings and remove ‚ÄúAutoinstall floppy disk‚Äù.
        
    7. Power on the machine and install manually.
        
        * *Ensure to select Desktop experience when installing to have GUI.*
            
    8. After installation you would be prompted to set admin password, set password.
        
    9. Install **VMware Tools** after installation for smooth integration.
        
    
    **Windows 10 Pro Setup**
    
    1. Select **Windows 10 Pro** during installation.

    2. Skip the **Product Key** section.
        
    3. Let VMware handle the setup process.

### **Enabling Ping in Windows Firewall**

By default, **ICMP (Ping) requests** are blocked on Windows OS. To enable them:

1. Open **Windows Defender Firewall** (wf.msc).
    
    * *(Press* `Windows Key + R`*,* `type wf.msc`*, and hit Enter.)*
        
2. Go to **Inbound Rules** ‚Üí Find **File and Printer Sharing (Echo Request ‚Äì ICMPv4-In)**.
    
3. Right-click ‚Üí **Enable Rule**.
    
4. Repeat on second VM
    

### **Testing Connectivity**

1. On the **Windows 10 client**, open **Command Prompt** and run:
    
    ```bash
    ipconfig
    ```
    
2. Note the as properlysigned IP address.
    
3. Ping the Windows Server:
    
    ```bash
    ping 192.168.100.142
    ```
    
4. If the **Windows Server responds**, the connection is successful.
    
5. Repeat this step on the **Windows Server** to ensure it can communicate with the Windows 10 VM.

2. Click **Inbound Rules** ‚Üí **New Rule**.
    
3. Select **Port** ‚Üí **Next**.
    
4. Choose **TCP**, enter the following ports, and click **Next**:
    
    * **389** (LDAP - Active Directory)
        
    * **22** (SSH)
        
    * **443** (HTTPS)
        
    * **3389** (RDP - Remote Desktop)
