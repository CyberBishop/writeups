**Knock knock knock… FBI 🚔 open up!**

For my fellow Linux enthusiasts, it’s safe to assume that at some point in your journey, you’ve come across this message:

> “Username is not in the sudoers file. This incident will be reported.”

**Reported to who?? Lol 😂**

Let’s break this down without getting too technical.

This error happens when a user who isn’t in the **sudo** group (or **wheel** group, depending on the Linux flavor) tries to execute a command with sudo privileges.

Why did they use the word **incident**?

### **What’s an Incident?**

In security terms, an **incident** is an event that could indicate a security threat or policy violation. Not all incidents are security issues, but they still get logged for analysis.

And yes, you **are** being reported. This event is logged in:

* **/var/log/auth.log** (on Debian-based distros like Ubuntu)
    
* **/var/log/secure** (on RHEL-based distros like CentOS & Fedora)
    

But… who’s going to check this file? **Is it not my laptop?** 🤷‍♂️

### **Here comes the SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)**

A **SIEM** is a centralized log management system that collects, normalizes, and correlates logs across multiple systems. Think of it as the **big brother of logs**—it:

* Collects logs from multiple devices (**endpoints**)
    
* Monitors and analyzes events for suspicious activities
    
* Triggers alerts based on predefined rules
    
* Can even generate **automatic tickets** that SOC (Security Operations Center) analysts respond to
    

Now, here’s the kicker, **in most organizations, endpoint monitoring agents come pre-installed as part of the base OS image.** So before you even **touch** that new company laptop… just know **you’re already being watched.** 👀

### **So, What Happens When You Trigger This Alert?**

1. Your failed **sudo** attempt is logged in the appropriate file.
    
2. The **SIEM agent or forwarder** installed on your endpoint forwards the log to the SIEM platform.
    
3. If the SIEM detects something fishy (like repeated unauthorized sudo attempts), it **automatically creates an alert.**
    
4. The alert is turned into a **ticket** for a SOC analyst to investigate.
    

**So yes, you are being reported. Don’t act surprised when the FBI comes knocking at your door. 🚔**

What does the SOC analyst do with this information? Well… you’ll have to wait for my next write-up to find out.
